wvdial (1.51) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Synchronise with libwvstreams v3.69

  * Changed WvDial to a native Debian Package (Closes: #131645)

  * New Maintainer for WvDial Patrick Patterson <ppatters@debian.org>, 
    taking over by mutual agreement from Baruch Even <baruch@debian.org>.

  * WvDialConf actually works with this release

  * Applied some patches from Andrew W. Nosenko <awn@bcs.zp.ua> that
    fix a couple of typos, and which makes sure that the wvdialconf man page
    gets installed.

  * Applied some patches from RedHat to make sure that WvDial and
    WvStreams compile clean on 64 bit architectures. Also did some cleanup
    to make sure that the goofy GCC that RedHat ships doesn't complain on
    some bits of WvDial.

  * Applied patches from SuSE to ensure that WvDial compiles cleanly 
    using GCC 3.1, as well, adapt a patch to make sure that wvdialconf
    creates the wvdial.conf file mode 660.Also applied their multi-phone
    number patch (so it will dial several phone numbers in order if you ask
    it nicely), as well as their check to make sure inherited sections 
    actually exist.

  * Applied patch from Dushyanth Harinath <dushy@symonds.net> to implement
    the "Dial Attempts" option, which will now cause WvDial to stop trying
    to dial after the number in this option is exceeded.

  * Applied a mega patch from SuSE that added better ISDN support, added USB
    modem support, added a "--no-syslog" option, inactivity timeouts,
    interactive passwords (WvDial will now prompt you for passwords if you
    ask it to), Connection checking once you're online (which can probably be
    adapted to run your copy of retchmail (or if you are still using fetchmail..
    I guess you could run that as well) once you are online. It also reputedly  
    works better with DialD.

  *  It should be mentioned somewhere that all of these nifty new features
     are pretty much completely untested. So please bang at them, look at them,
     and please send the bug reports to wvdial-list@lists.nit.ca. That's where 
     all of the cool wvdial hackers hang out ;)
